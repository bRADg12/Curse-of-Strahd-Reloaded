### Recap

Last time you guys began by exploring the dungeon you found underneath the "Death House". You were trying to follow the sound of a ghostly chanting but ran into 3 ghouls that materialized out of viscera that was previously on the floor. After Darrick turned one of the undead you vanquished the other 2 and continued your search. You then came upon a dark staircase leading you deeper underground. You found a shrine featuring a cloaked figure holding a crystal ball, but realizing that time was of the essence you investigated no further in hopes to find the beast before the clock struck midnight. You ventured on to find a water covered stone chamber with an alter in the middle complete with shackles and a dagger. The altar had a small white bundle atop it, but just as you decided on what to do the clock struck 12 and the fleshy mound in the corner of the room came to life and tore the walls down behind you.
As the fight broke out, Morr raised her Amber Shard aloft and spoke the name "Walter" subduing the monster into a daze. The fight raged on but you all kept composure and strategized wisely (Goatler took the amulet and used its power to quell the beast's rage, Darrick used his superior constitution to stay upclose and get some damage in, and Morr took advantage of her agility to dodge attacks and deal some damage of her own). Ultimately it was Goatler, who cast a Thunder Wave that defeated the monster, and that's where we are now...
