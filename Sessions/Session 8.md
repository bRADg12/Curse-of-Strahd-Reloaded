### Recap
Welcome to Barovia, a dark and dreary land plagued by gloom and dark mystical powers. 

Last session you found Ireena on the edge of town digging for a small wooden box that contained a silver bracelet beset with gems. She then explained that hadn't been fully honest with you and revealed fang-marks on her neck. She was upset in revealing that Strahd had been toying with her, visiting late in the night and hypnotizing then biting her. She assured you that she was of sound mind and body then you all embarked on your voyage to Vallaki.

You set out on the Old Svalich Road. It wasn't long before you encountered the place described by Doru as Van Richten's weapon cache. In the clearing you found 5 shambling figures, 1 had sickly white skin with plumes of red mist falling from its mouth. Before the zombies could spot you Darrick turned all of the lesser zombies causing them to flee. You fought the pale undead sustaining heavy damage, the fight featured a few knockouts but you eventually prevailed with help of Ireena's potions.

After retrieving the contents of the weapons cache you continued to the North to head for the Tser Pool encampment. As you finished crossing the bridge you spotted a sleek carriage pulled by 2 black mares. The driver opened the carriage door to reveal a tall, pale, well dressed figure with dark slicked back hair. His noble adornments precluded his introduction as Count Strahd von Zarovich. 

He greeted Ireena then turned his attention on you all, and that's where we are now
