### Recap

Last session you began in the dungeon of the Death House. After defeating the beast, you were startled by the ghost of Elisabeth Durst who told you she would "tear this house down rather than let you escape!" You fled post haste only to run into her husband Gustav who Goatler and Darrick convinced to let you all pass; he also gave some advice to help you on your way out. After you made it out the house sunk into the ground leaving nothing behind save for a empty bottomless pit. Darrick then caught a glimpse of torchlight and you followed it to an abandoned tower that looked suitable for a campsite.
The next morning, you awoke and began venturing down a road you could see through the dense misty fog that surrounded you. Through the mists you all saw shadowy figures along the trail that seemed to fade in and out of existence, some humanoid, others avian or even draconic in nature. You soon came upon a corpse holding a copper compass and a notched tree with an arrow pointing down a footpath. You followed the footpath to find another such tree, and another. After following the footpath through the dense fog, you emerged back on the road where you began, but the bodies you found earlier had vanished. After leaving the site and following the road, the mists parted and you caught a glimpse of a town in front of you, with mountains on either side and castle spire in the distance. And that's where we are now...
