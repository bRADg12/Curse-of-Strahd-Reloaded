### Recap
Welcome to Barovia, a dark and dreary land plagued by gloom and dark mystical powers. 

Last session you encountered a wereraven and although you dispatched it quickly it managed to infect Morr after an attack. Darrick and Goatler checked the wound after battle and you saw that Morr's blood was turning black, Darrick recognized this as the beginnings of a curse of lycanthropy. 
You continued on to find the village of Barovia in a state of disarray, barricades and makeshift weapons scattered amongst the wreckage of an attack. You went into the Blood of the Vine Tavern to meet Ismark Kolyanovich who began explaining the predicament of the village. The priest's son Doru lead a group of young rebels to fight against the forces of Castle Ravenloft, they were never seen again. 100 days later Strahd's forces began their assault and seige on the village. Ismark swore you to secrecy and told you that a vampire has been seen haunting the grounds of his family manor and while the village was under siege the monsters were relentless in seeking out his sister Ireena. Ismark plead for you to take Ireena to St. Andral's Church in Vallaki to keep her safe.
A boisterous patron interrupted Ismark and you all and began berating the new Burgomaster for asking everyone to stay and fight instead of fleeing Strahd's forces.
Just then a woman came into the bar and pleaded with Ismark to look for her missing daughter Gertruda. Ismark assured her that he would send a search party out as soon as possible and led her home.
You all made your way to the Burgomaster's manor to meet Ireena, but were quickly ushered away as the Kolyanovich siblings had a conversation in private. Morr unabashedly listened in and relayed that the siblings fought over Ireena staying and their shared duties to the remaining citizens of Barovia and to each other. Ismark asked you to assist them in the burial of their father before dawn and then found your rooms for the night before being called down to dinner. 
And that's where we are now...
