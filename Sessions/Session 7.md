### Recap
Welcome to Barovia, a dark and dreary land plagued by gloom and dark mystical powers. 

We began last session with you all around the Kolyanovich dinner table, after gaining information about Ireena's past and the vampire Strahd you went to bed for the night. Morr dreamt of drifting off too the bright full moon before you all gathered into a collective dream where Madame Eva warned through her gift of insight she has seen Strahd taking an interest in you and your fates are tied to that of the land. You awoke to bury the father of Ismark and Ireena Kolyan at the church in Barovia, upon getting to the church you saw that it was in a state of disarray. Father Donavich sadly explained that his own son turned Vampire Spawn was the cause of the destruction and he was locked in the basement. You all parlayed with Doru and he allowed you to tie him up as you exposed fresh blood to him. He held fast and was able to keep his composure, after you untied him he then gave you the location of Van Richten's weapons cache. You then had a rather tenuous shopping trip that ended with Goatler being spanked by Parriwimple and that's where we are now.
